# MATLAB-Projects-with-Android-Sensors
Explore the MATLAB hardware support for android sensors and develop interesting applications.

The m files will only work with a previous version of MATLAB and MATLAB Mobile because the 
new MATLAB and android application doesn't allow real time logging of data anymore. One can 
always collect the data and manipulate the logged data using simple algorithms in the MATLAB
environment.

The Projects are as follows:
# 1. Counting Steps :
This project involves the use of accelerometer sensor data from the phone and using a very simple
algorithm to count the number of steps taken.
This example is included in the Mathworks website but I have used an algorithm instead of the functions
of signal processing toolbox to count the steps.

# 2. Compass :
This project uses the magnetometer sensor data from the phone to display a real time compass showing the direction
in which the phone is pointing.

# 3. Up or Down :
This project uses the orientation sensors to detect whether the phone is pointing upwards or downwards by using the
orientation sensor data from the phone.

# 4. VR Box:
This is a very interesting application of the data coming from the sensors to display a virtual box in MATLAB environment
move and rotate according to the movement of phone in real time.

# 5. Shaking:
This project uses the angular velocity sensor data coming from the phone to detect whether the phone is idle or moving.

# 6. Plot Position:
An interesting application of the GPS sensors to plot the position of the phone in a google map. Sensor data can be logged in
real time or can be collected and then logged to generate the points on the map.
